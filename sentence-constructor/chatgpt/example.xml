    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Spanish words, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the formal "usted" form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
