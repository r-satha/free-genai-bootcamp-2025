Considerations and Next Steps:

- This sentence contains two parts: a **question** in past tense and a **statement** about an ongoing change.
- The first part asks if the person has seen something, so the verb **"to see"** must be in past tense.
- The second part describes a change in state (players becoming greedy), so the verb **"to become"** needs to be in progressive tense.
- Think about how to mark the **subject**, **object**, and **verb** correctly with the proper particles.
- The structure of the sentence will be different in Spanish compared to English.

You can:

- Try forming the question using the vocabulary and past tense of "to see."
- Ask about how to express "becoming" correctly in Spanish.
- Attempt the full sentence and ask for feedback.
